      <p>
        <span>Unless you have been living under a rock you will be aware about the panic surrounding the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pandemic origination from Hubei province in China, and in particular originating in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei. The city is in complete lockdown since Jan 23rd. This was done to contain the epidemic and prevent further spread of the virus throughout the rest of China and the world. I will not discuss much further details since this is very well documented by the news media and the internet.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span>The problem has been that we the public have so little information to really understand what is really happening. Is there a real global danger and will the Chinese authorities successfully contain the problem. There appears to be a lot of fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) that is making the whole world very nervous. With the very little hard information we have, can we estimate the dangers ahead.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span>In order to try to shed some light, I set out to model the behavior of the epidemic. In order to create any sort of model we first need to lay out the facts that we know, or think we know. Further, we also need to make some simplifying assumptions. So here is what I believe we know along with some assumptions:</span>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p role="presentation">
            <span>The source of the epidemic is believed to be at a large seafood and live animal market.</span>

        </li>
        <li>
          <p role="presentation">
            <span>The initially infected people were directly infected at the market, but we do not know:</span>

        The error function is the RMS of official values and predicted lavues. Since we are dealing with exponential growth, a simple RMS would be too concerned about large values 
        and put very little on the smaller values earlier in time. The best way to way to account for this is to take the log of the values. This gives a more balanced error function.
