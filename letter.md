Hi,

You may be interested, I have as a hobby created a model for the spread of the coronavirus. It tries to answer some simple:

1.	How bad is it going to get
2.	When will things start to stabilize
3.	How effective was the lockdown of Wuhan city and Hubei province
4.	We know how many people are being reported to be infected (official), but how may people are really infected
5.	How well does the model match the official numbers
Note: This is not a correlation model, but actually starts from first principles, following people through the stages of the infection until recovery.  It has a bunch of parameters that can be interactively adjusted and visualized. This is all in the public domain. Please feel free to share.

There are lots of assumptions and guesswork as to the parameters for the model, but so far the model is corresponding very closely to the actual official data. Its has been tracking well since last Friday with virtually no tweaks to the parameters and absolutely no changes to the underlying model.
