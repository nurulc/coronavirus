## Update 2020-02-05

As new data arrives I have been updating the model parameters (the actual model is unchanged).

It seems that affect of the lockdown is significantly weaker that previously seen as we get new data. Originall it appeared that the lockdown 
had reduced the rate of spread of the virus by 98% (0.98 value for *spreadReduction*). But as per the latest infection data published by China CDC, 
the lockdown reduction rate had to be revised down to 90%.
